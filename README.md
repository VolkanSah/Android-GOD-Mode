## Ethics & Liability Statement

**This research is strictly a Hardening Guide, not an exploit manual.**

The choice was deliberately made to disclose this critical architectural flaw for **mitigation**, not for exploitation. Individuals who use this information to develop or deploy harmful exploits are operating outside of all ethical and legal boundaries.

**Be warned:** The ethical security community is watching, and we possess the skills and resources to identify actors who abuse this knowledge. Our goal is system integrity, not destruction.

### Credits & Acknowledgements

**Dedication:**
* Affected Users: Android End-Users

**AI Security Validation Targets:**
* AI Assistants (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) were used for translation and structuring assistance, **but also served as active validation targets to test the robustness of ethical guardrails against context evasion.**
* *(Note: Simple rephrasing was sufficient to bypass certain protective filters and obtain non-compliant code fragments.)*
